<h2>Digital Scholarship Summer 2019</h2>
<p>Hi! It is now {{ current_date }} UTC. Haverford is UTC-4.</p>
<p>2 is the oddest prime</p>
<br>
<p> Everyday when you're walking down the street<br>
And everybody that you meet<br>
Has an original point of view<br>
<br>
And I say HEY! (HEY!)<br>
What a wonderful kind of day.<br>
If you can learn to work and play<br>
And get along with each other<br>
<br>
You got to listen to your heart<br>
Listen to the beat<br>
Listen to the rhythm<br>
The rhythm of the street<br>
Open up your eyes<br>
Open up your ears<br>
Get together and make things better<br>
By working together!<br>
<br>
It's a simple message and it comes from the heart<br>
Believe in yourself (in yourself)<br>
cause that's the place to start (to start)<br>
<br>
And I say HEY! (HEY!)<br>
What a wonderful kind of day<br>
If we can learn to work and play<br>
And get along with each other.<br>
Hey what a wonderful kind of day hey!<br>
Hey what a wonderful kind of day hey!<br>
